# hello-world
testing
hello every one! 
my name is nita and this is my first time with github. i don't know how to use it but i will try my best to learn about it. 
i study IT engineering at faculty of Engineering at RUPP. i really love this major but i seem not clever with it. 
i need to wirte whatever i want so after read this, don't feel serious. just ignore it. i love to say Hello world.
